This version I intent to make price tracker app.
It still uses the same user authentication flow as v1.

This app need celery worker and redis to distribute tasks

1. start redis container by `docker run --name maitet-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis`. If the container was started, just need to start it again `docker start maitet-redis`
2. start celery worker by `celery --app core worker -l DEBUG`
